The Deep Photo Style Transfer paper has the needed equations for all the the authors adjustments to the nerual style model. The paper includes the type of compute needed for running the model to abtain their results. The Paper approaches the algorithm at a higher level and lacks pseudo-code, which should not be a problem given that their model (and the model the authors based their code on) is avalible on GitHub. Each hyper-parameter relevant to the adjustments and addtions that the authors made to the nerual style model are included. Other factors to consider are that the images used by the authors are also avaliable. With all these features in mind, it seems likely that this is paper that can be reproduced. 

To reproduce the Deep Photo Style Transfer model it is first important to recreate the nerual style model, then adjust the model to prevent deformations in the output. That being considered below is a starting timeline.
